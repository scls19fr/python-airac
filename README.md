Regular, planned Aeronautical Information Publications (AIP) as defined by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) are published and become effective at fixed dates.

AIRAC cycle definition as published in the [ICAO Aeronautical Information Services Manual (DOC 8126; AN/872; 6th Edition; 2003)](https://www.icao.int/NACC/Documents/Meetings/2014/ECARAIM/REF09-Doc8126.pdf). Test cases validate documented dates from 2003 until 2022. They also assert that the rare cases of a 14th cycle, e. g. in the years 2020 and 2043 are correctly handled.
